musb(Mentor USB) Registers and `embassy-usb-driver` , `usb-device` Implementation.

The MUSBMHDRC (musb) is a USB 2.0 Multi-Point, Dual-Role Controller designed by Mentor Graphics Corp. It is widely used by various manufacturers in microcontrollers and SoCs, including companies like TI, MediaTek, Puya, Allwinner, and others.

## Quick Start

These built-in profiles are used via Cargo features (see below), with only one selectable:

- `builtin-py32f07x` (py32m070, py32f071, py32f072)

- `builtin-py32f403`

- `builtin-sf32lb52x`

- `builtin-std-8bep-2048` (8 bidirectional endpoints, 2048K FIFO size in total, without instance)

Add musb to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
musb = { version = "0.3.0", features = ["builtin-std-8bep-2048"] }
```

You can use the [std profile](registers/profiles/) by enabling the `builtin-std-xxx` feature. This profile doesn't include a base_address, so it won't generate a `UsbInstance` (explained in [Porting Guide](docs/porting_guide.md)).

If your chip is not included, you'll need to create a new profile. Refer to the [Porting Guide](docs/porting_guide.md) for more details.

## Features

`embassy-usb-driver-impl`: Enables [embassy-usb-driver](https://crates.io/crates/embassy-usb-driver) implementation.

`usb-device-impl`: Enables [usb-device](https://crates.io/crates/usb-device) implementation.

**Note:** Only one of these two implementations can be enabled at a time.

`prebuild`(on by default): Uses pre-generated PAC (Peripheral Access Crate).

`builtin-xxxx` : Uses builtin profile.

`defmt`, `log`: Enables debug logging.
